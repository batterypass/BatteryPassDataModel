## Overview
The Battery Pass Data Model is designed to facilitate the digital representation of battery-related data, ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements. This model supports the efficient exchange of data between various stakeholders in the battery lifecycle, including manufacturers, suppliers, recyclers, and regulators.

## Features
- **Standardized Data Representation:** Ensures uniformity in the way battery data is recorded and shared.
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Includes all critical aspects of battery data as specified in the Battery Pass Content Guidance.
- **Scalability:** Suitable for use in projects of varying scales, from small businesses to large enterprises.
- **Interoperability:** Facilitates seamless data exchange between different systems and platforms.
