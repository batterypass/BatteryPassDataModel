## Overview
The Battery Pass Data Model is designed to facilitate the digital representation of battery-related data, ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements. This model supports the efficient exchange of data between various stakeholders in the battery lifecycle, including manufacturers, suppliers, recyclers, and regulators.

## Features
- **Standardized Data Representation:** Ensures uniformity in the way battery data is recorded and shared.
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Includes all critical aspects of battery data as specified in the Battery Pass Content Guidance.
- **Scalability:** Suitable for use in projects of varying scales, from small businesses to large enterprises.
- **Interoperability:** Facilitates seamless data exchange between different systems and platforms.

## Installation
To use the Battery Pass Data Model, you can clone the repository and integrate it into your project. Ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/batterypass/BatteryPassDataModel.git
cd BatteryPassDataModel
```

## Usage
To incorporate the data model into your application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/batterypass/BatteryPassDataModel.git
   ```

2. **Import the Data Model:**
   Integrate the provided data model definitions into your database or application schema. Refer to the documentation in the `/docs` directory for detailed description of the battery pass data attributes.

3. **Customize as Needed:**
   Adapt the data model to fit your specific requirements. Ensure any modifications remain compliant with the Battery Pass Content Guidance.

## Data Model Structure
The data model is organized into several parameter categories, each representing a different dedicated aspect of battery data, that can be composed to a complete battery pass data model. Below is a high-level overview. You'll find a detailed list with descriptions of the individual data points in the `/doc` folder. Follow the links for the different

Detailed schema definitions and relationships between entities are provided in the `/BatteryPassSchema` directory. 
For the compilation of the data model schema, the [Eclipse Semantic Modeling Framework](https://eclipse-esmf.github.io/esmf-documentation/index.html) was used, that provides a meta model for data modelling for data exchange purpose based on RDF.
